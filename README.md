## Isolations Silos
* [Authentic8](https://www.authentic8.com/)
* [Maxthon's Cloud Browser](https://www.maxthon.com/)

# Firewalls
* Simpler firewalls are based on layers 3 or 4 to accept o reject traffic based on Port, Protocol and Address
* More complex firewalls work at the application layer to do DPI (Deep Packet Inspection), they can determine whether the traffic conforms to the profile set for a particular port. 
* Host based firewalls like Windows Firewall or Linux IP tables are found on computers.
* Egress filtering: - Blocking outgoing traffic. This can prevent malware from communicating back out to a command centre.

### Type 2

* [VMPlayer](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)

### Type 1
* [Xenserver](https://xenproject.org/developers/teams/xen-hypervisor/)

### Hybrid
#### Linux
* [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) - [See also, Virtual Machine Manager](https://virt-manager.org/)
* [OpenVZ](https://openvz.org/)
* [Linux Containers](https://linuxcontainers.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Virtualization Risks
* [Venom](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/venom-vulnerability-details/)
* [White Rabbit VT-D attack](https://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/2011/Software%20Attacks%20on%20Intel%20VT-d.pdf)

### Virtual Machine Hardening
* Use a USB based network adapter to isolate from the host adapter.
* USe whole disk encryption on the host operating system to prevent logs, caches etc being used as an attack point from the host.
* Clear down swap space and caches after use
* Use Hypervisor encryption
* Disable all unnecessary functions like:
     * 3D accelerateion, serial ports, video acceleration, drag and drop/clipboard. 
     * If possible do not install VMWare tools and VirtualBox extensions.
     *  Do not redirect USB and disable the USB controller (USe a PS2 Mouse on the VM). 
     *  Enable PAE/NX.
     *  Consider live operating systems and if possible do not use persistent storage.
     *  Use snapshots for a clean machine on each new activity.
     *  Avoid hybernating or sleeping VMs - keys are stored in memory or the harddisk.

## Other Isolation Technologies
* Device Guard - Windows 10

# Operating Systems for Security and Privacy
## Whonix
### Strengths
* [whonix](https://www.whonix.org) A whonix workstation connects directly to a thor based gateway and is isolated from a local LAN.
     * Anonymising Relay Monitor - [ARM](https://github.com/katmagic/arm) - similar to top on unix, but for Tor. Command line application for monitoring Tor relays, providing real time status information such as the current configuration, bandwidth usage, message log, connections, etc.
     * SDWdate - an anonomous time service used by whonix, also used by Tor, unlike NTP it preserves anonimity.
     * The whonix gateway can be used by other VMs and non-whonix workstations to provide secure access.
### Weaknesses
* It is easy to identify if someone is using whonix.
* Whonix does not encrypt by default.
* It does not protect again rootkits etc.
* It does not protect against hardware compromise.
* It can be difficult set up requiring virtual machines or additional hardware.
* Unlike tails (and other amnesic operating systems) whonix can leaves traces on the hardware.


## Qubes
### Strengths
* Desktop OS based on xen hypervisor; it uses virtualisation for isolation between security domains.
* Qubes Templates allow the desktop to be comfigured liked popular operating systems.
* Unlike momolithic architectures (Trusted Components Base) were a lot of code runs with elevated privalleges, xen is a type 1 hypervisor and quebes runs a micro kernel on top of this. This provides distinct advantages by reducing the attack space.
* Dom0 controls the screen and desktop, but has no network access.
* Applications run in different VMs, but Dom0 presents this as a single desktop.
* There is a Net VM which takes care of all network activity. Even is the network VM is compromised the malicious code still cannot escalate privellege to reach other isolated components.
* USB can also be isolated in a VM.
* Each application can run in a seperate VM, so we could have a browser for banking and a browser for hacking, for example.
* Qubes has built in integration with Tor.


### Weaknesses
* It supports a limited range of hardware at the moment.- [see the Hardware Compatability List](https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/)
*
     
### Security Domains and Isolation
* Consider isolating your activites into different domains, use a virtualised or sandboxed browser to surf the web to isolate routine activities from attack.


# Router Security
* Shodan is the world's first search engine for Internet-connected devices. [Shodan Web Site](https://www.shodan.io/)
     * We can use Shodan to search for vunerabilities, for example searching for 'Default Password' shows devices still using the default password and username.
     * It features an exploits database: [https://exploits.shodan.io/welcome](https://exploits.shodan.io/welcome)
     * We can search for an IP address using https://www.shodan.io/host/ followed by the ip address

# SSH
* ssh-keygen - generate public keys in a folder of your choosing
* Linux: ssh-copy-id -i /home/${USER}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  <remote_user_name>@<remote_ip_address>
* [Generating SSH key-pairs on Windows](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/flashsystem-9x00/8.3.x?topic=host-generating-ssh-key-pair-using-putty)

# OAuth 2.0
* [Implementation in Nodejs](https://github.com/danba340/oauth-github-example) -- [Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdFdd4N6LtI)
